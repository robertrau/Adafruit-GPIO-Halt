Adafruit-GPIO-Halt for PiFly
============================

Press-to-halt program for headless Raspberry Pi. Similar functionality to the rpi_power_switch kernel module from the fbtft project, but easier to compile (no kernel headers needed).

This version has been modified to support the PiFly HAT board for the raspberry Pi Zero. See:

The PiFly has an install script that installs this and much more. See:
